On the Deep Pine Road of Ling Gu Temple, the golden ginkgo forest and the small, round ginkgo leaves, just one can capture the charm of the entire autumn. The red and yellow walls of the temple, set off by the autumn leaves, appear particularly warm and solemn, reflecting the liveliest season in Nanjing. A gust of autumn wind blew, and the ginkgo leaves danced in the air like golden butterflies, eventually falling to the ground and spreading a golden carpet, making people feel as if they had stepped into a golden fairy tale world. The autumn in Ling Gu Scenic Area is not only a visual feast but also a touch of the soul, allowing people to feel the serenity of time and the beauty of nature in this tranquility and splendor.",
